            li You arrive at the airport and are approached by a friendly individual.
            li You're offered a free ride in a luxury car and sometimes lunch, based on your airline.
            li The next day, you're picked up from your hotel for a tour of "amazing" investment properties and building sites.

            li You're taken to a very impressive sales room with models, animations, and a high-pressure atmosphere.
            li The goal is to get you to pay a $10,000 deposit on the spot.
            li They claim the deposit is refundable, but insist you pay immediately before you have time for any research.

            p They will pressure you to leave a positive Trustpilot review about their "hospitality".
            ul.timeline-list
              li <strong>If you write a review:</strong> You'll likely write about the nice car and fancy lunch, not the high-pressure sales tactics.
              li <strong>If you refuse to write a review:</strong> They will offer to create a Trustpilot account for you and write a review on your behalf.
              li <strong>If you let them write it:</strong> They post a generic, positive review that looks fake and promotes their staff. This is how they flood review sites with seemingly good feedback, hiding the real, negative reviews about the actual "investment".
              li <strong>If you refuse to let them write it:</strong> You walk away without losing any money. This is the best possible outcome in this scenario.

            p They send you contracts with a payment schedule.
            ul.timeline-list
              li <strong>If you try to opt-out:</strong> They'll point to fine print in the contract stating the deposit is non-refundable. You've lost your $10,000.
              li <strong>If you continue with payments:</strong> You'll keep paying for an unfinished project. You'll receive "updates" that eventually turn into "delays".

            h4 The Final Payment
            p They will pressure you to make the final payment, claiming the project is complete.
            ul.timeline-list
              li <strong>If you refuse the final payment:</strong> You try to cancel the contract, but they keep all the money you've paid so far, and you get nothing.
              li <strong>If you make the final payment:</strong> You get the property, but it's worth far less than claimed, with hidden fees. A different company "manages" it, taking most of the rental income. You can't sell it, and you're stuck with inflated utility and maintenance bills. Many suspect these "maintenance" issues are fabricated, and the money is simply pocketed.
